Greetings! I am a senior web developer and had been worked at Upwork for about 10 years.

On Upwork.com, there are many cool clients and jobs but I can’t take any big jobs because I live in Asia.

Due to different timezone, most clients don’t like to work with Asian developer.

I want to use your Upwork account on your computer via Anydesk remotely. 
You will be paid %10 ~ %12 of my income every month. 

You will be responsible to provide one spare computer to me full time.
