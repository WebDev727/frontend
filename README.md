# frontend

Greetings! I am a senior web developer and had been worked in the web development for about 10 years.

In your country (US), there are many cool clients and jobs but I can’t take any big jobs because I live in Asia.

Due to different timezone, most clients don’t like to work with Asian developer.

I would like to take US only jobs and join the US software company team with US citizenship.

So if you can help me, I can join the US software company with your citizenship.

All development will be done myself on my side. For this business, I will give you %30 of the income from company. It will be more than 10K in a month. Your will be 30%.

I can handle 3 ~ 5 companies. 

Are you interested in?
